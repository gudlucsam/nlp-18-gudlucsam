A very, very, very slow-moving, aimless movie about a distressed, drifting young man.
Not sure who was more lost - the flat characters or the audience, nearly half of whom walked out.
Attempting artiness with black & white and clever camera angles, the movie disappointed - became even more ridiculous - as the acting was poor and the plot and lines almost non-existent.
Very little music or anything to speak of.
The best scene in the movie was when Gerardo is trying to find a song that keeps running through his head.
